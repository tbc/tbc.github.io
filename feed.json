Trump was known for his reality TV show &ldquo;The Apprentice,&rdquo; while Gentle is described as a former lounge singer and B-movie actor. This reflects a critique on the blurring lines between entertainment and politics, where charisma and public persona play significant roles in political success.</li>\n<li><strong>Populist Appeal:</strong> Both figures capitalized on a populist wave, appealing to voters who felt disenfranchised by traditional politics. Trump&rsquo;s campaign was marked by anti-establishment rhetoric, promising to &ldquo;Make America Great Again,&rdquo; while Gentle is portrayed as a leader of the &ldquo;Clean U.S. Party&rdquo; (C.U.S.P.), promising to clean up America from both literal and metaphorical pollution.</li>\n<li><strong>Nationalism and Isolationism:</strong> There&rsquo;s a shared theme of nationalism. Trump&rsquo;s policies, like his stance on immigration and international trade, reflect a form of nationalism and isolationism. Similarly, Gentle&rsquo;s policies involve isolating America by creating the &ldquo;Great Concavity,&rdquo; a vast waste dump area given to Canada, reflecting a form of extreme nationalism.</li>\n<li><strong>Germaphobia:</strong> Trump has been known for his particular attention to hygiene, notably avoiding handshakes during the early stages of his presidency due to health concerns. Johnny Gentle is explicitly described as a severe germaphobe, to the extent of wearing surgical masks and promoting extreme cleanliness.</li>\n<li><strong>Use of Vulgar Language:</strong> Both Trump and Gentle are noted for their use of profanity in public or political forums, which was somewhat unprecedented for their respective times. Trump&rsquo;s use of coarse language was often highlighted in the media, while Gentle is depicted as the first U.S. President to say &ldquo;shit&rdquo; publicly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Differences:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Political Experience:</strong> Trump had some political experience before becoming president, having been involved in politics, though his background was primarily in business. Johnny Gentle, on the other hand, is portrayed with no prior political experience, jumping directly from entertainment to the presidency, which serves as a satirical commentary on American politics.</li>\n<li><strong>Policy Execution:</strong> While Trump implemented policies that often stirred controversy, like border wall construction, tax reforms, and immigration policies, Gentle&rsquo;s policies in &ldquo;Infinite Jest&rdquo; are more extreme and surreal, like giving away toxic land to Canada or the concept of &ldquo;Subsidized Time&rdquo; where years are sponsored by corporations.</li>\n<li><strong>Outcome and Legacy:</strong> Trump&rsquo;s presidency was marked by significant domestic and international impacts, including economic policies, judicial appointments, and international relations. Johnny Gentle&rsquo;s administration in the novel leads to a dystopian scenario where America&rsquo;s obsession with entertainment leads to its downfall, with a focus on cultural and environmental decay.</li>\n<li><strong>Character Depth:</strong> Wallace uses Gentle to explore themes of entertainment addiction, environmentalism, and political satire in a deeply philosophical and absurd manner. Trump, as a real-life figure, embodies these themes but through the lens of actual policy, personal behavior, and political strategy, providing a different kind of narrative and public discourse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, while Donald Trump and Johnny Gentle share some thematic and superficial similarities, their differences lie in the execution and the reality versus fiction of their political actions and personal characteristics.

Friday <a href=\"https://x.com/tbc0/status/1809414361557135415\">I twittered</a> that I was coming out of retirement to write a book. I have two working titles: <em>Internet Wisdom, First Edition</em>, and <em>Sparky&rsquo;s Booklet</em>. I am not even sure what it&rsquo;s about, yet. I started writing it in my commonplace book (c-book for short) a little bit at a time, out of order. I wrote &ldquo;Begin my book&rdquo; in my c-book on October 17, 2021. (That was 1183 days after I started gathering my thoughts in my c-book, by the way. I knew it was going to take a while to come together, not that the only reason I keep a c-book is to write books.)</p>\n<p>I like to say that the first draft of my book is already written. All the words are in my c-book. Problem is, the words are not in the right order. And I don&rsquo;t think the first draft is salable.

				"content_text": "Stream-of-consciousness blogging. I have a committed audience of one. (Hi, Son!)\r\n\r\nI retired April 1st (no kidding). I was not adjusting to it very well. Friday [I twittered](https://x.com/tbc0/status/1809414361557135415) that I was coming out of retirement to write a book. I have two working titles: *Internet Wisdom, First Edition*, and *Sparky's Booklet*. I am not even sure what it's about, yet. I started writing it in my commonplace book (c-book for short) a little bit at a time, out of order. I wrote \"Begin my book\" in my c-book on October 17, 2021. (That was 1183 days after I started gathering my thoughts in my c-book, by the way. I knew it was going to take a while to come together, not that the only reason I keep a c-book is to write books.)\r\n\r\nI like to say that the first draft of my book is already written. All the words are in my c-book. Problem is, the words are not in the right order. And I don't think the first draft is salable. Meanwhile, I blog.\r\n\r\nI am writing this sitting inside [Pikes Peak Brewing Company (PPBC)](https://www.pikespeakbrewing.com/).

I expected I’d soon be able to buy them directly from the artists. I still hold out hope that someday musical artists will make a decent living supported by their fans through direct micropayments. Meanwhile, there’s CD Baby. (Thank you, Derek Sivers!) You can pay in chunks. I’m a fan of The Cook Trio. Delightful Gypsy jazz. And I will never forget the radical internet music pioneer Janis Ian.

Then again, I would like to think that The Holy Spirit woke me up because I had work to do. Writing is work. To work is to pray. Therefore, by writing, I pray. And the purpose of prayer is to seek unity with the Creator of the Universe—thank you, Fr. Scott. But that’s enough theology for now.)</p>\n<p>I think Larry Sanger is onto something. I red Part 1 of his blog series, “How Not to Use the Internet.” I agree: it’s a problem that the internet distracts us. And I am also reading Charles Murray’s piece in the <em>New Criterion</em>, “Future tense, IX: Out of the wilderness.” (Thank you, Arts &amp; Letters Daily for the teaser, “What conditions give rise to great artistic achievements? Wealth, urban centers, belief in God. Wait: What? <em>Secularism is incompatible with creativity</em>&hellip;”) In fact, Part 2 of Larry’s piece (Part 1 of which I finished uninterrupted—1737 words according to Microsoft Word), is sitting right ahead of Murray’s piece in my Instapaper folder. (I’m not reading my collection in sequence. And, by the way, Instapaper totally rocks! I’m reading that folder offline in my Kindle app as a .mobi “magazine.”) His piece is 5592 words and I’m 1794 words into it. Coincidence, I don’t think so.</p>\n<p>When I red Murray’s sentence, “In literature, the organizing structure that created an eruption of great work starting in the late eighteenth century was overwhelmingly dominated by a new principle: the modern novel,” I was hooked. Who has time for novels anymore? Well, I do. Sort of. I recently became aware of Thomas Pynchon’s existence. It seems he wrote an award-winning postmodern novel. Murray assumes his readers know this. I haven’t red the first word of it, though. The book I’m focused most on is a pair of stories in one volume: <em>Not Quite Dead Enough</em> and <em>Booby Trap</em> by Rex Stout. This book is a milestone for me. I’ve red other long works electronically. In the 90’s I had an IBM PC-XT that ran on two AA batteries and fit in the palm of my hand. I red <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> on it. I got through it, but it took much longer because it wasn’t very comfortable. I had to use some custom software to rotate the text into portrait mode, and the LCD contrast was not restful on the eyes, unlike a modern Kindle. I still haven’t finished <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. I started it on an iPod Touch. I red a chapter or three in paperback, and I downloaded it to my NOOKcolor™. (That e-reader didn’t survive a fall from the floorboard of my car to the pavement. R.I.P.) It’s still sitting in my NOOK app library on my iPad, beckoning me. I don’t know how quickly I’ll finish it. But I fully intend to get through Stout’s nostalgic, light yet profound pair of stories on my iPad. They’re both contained in the first ebook I ever checked out from my library. (Thank you, Pikes Peak Library District, for inspiring me in 1979 with the idea that technology can make the humanities better!) I’ve already “renewed” it once (re-download after timebomb auto-delete). I have sixteen days left before I have to repeat that awkward yet tolerable (hey, what can one honestly expect for free?!) process. And so, for me, the novel is well underway toward being supplanted by electronic text.</p>\n<p>Murray is also elaborating on music as art. That went digital before books, as we all know. My lovely and talented wife giddily shared her new acquisitions as we carpooled home yesterday evening: Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” and Carrie Underwood’s “Before He Cheats.” (Oops. A tiny bit of her privacy just leaked onto the internet. Sorry, Sweetheart. Forgive me?) This was also a milestone. She paid $1.29 apiece. She said it was the first time she’d bought tracks since obtaining an iPhone.

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nI love the art of digital letter writing (AoDLW)! It&rsquo;s not the same as ephemeral email. (You <em>do</em> archive your important email, don&rsquo;t you?) My handwriting is poor (a disability of being left-handed), but I still enjoy breaking out the fountain pen every so often and committing words to paper in my ugly (but unique and personal) script. Script isn’t even taught in all elementary schools anymore. May I live long enough to see that trend reversed! Many cultures know the value of communicating with one&rsquo;s hands. Not all people have the ability to write with their hands, but for the able-bodied, typing is not what it means to be fully human.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the first rule of digital letter writing: <strong>No TOFU</strong> (“Text Over, Fullquote Under”). A letter should stand alone. Most mail apps add TOFU by default. Delete it before sending. Email has meta-data that automatically “threads” replies, anyway. Making every letter stand on its own is more challenging than continuing to top-post replies. It&rsquo;s good to think about style. For daily email—and even for informal letters—TOFU helps keep the entire conversation in one place. But I find it liberating to write without TOFU. I can associate freely, and I can choose how much context to include.</p>\n<p>There is a risk that the letter writer won’t include enough context, and the recipient will have to review previous correspondence. Again, that’s what email “threads” are for. Also, don’t give up the ancient tradition of saving correspondence for future reference. (I Twittered about letter-writing a long time ago [<a href=\"https://j.mp/ys0hDZ\">1of2</a>, <a href=\"https://j.mp/AcKBHS\">2of2</a>]). Before email, I made photocopies of my letters. Before photocopies, we used carbon paper, and before that people had to copy letters by hand before sending. Not all practiced such discipline, and more’s the pity. Note that we have Thomas Jefferson’s correspondence because he made copies of all the letters he sent. Jefferson (not counting his flaws) is one of my heroes. (And Clay Jenkinson is also my hero because he brings Jefferson to life through chautauqua. But I digress.) So the second rule of letter writing is: <strong>Archive your correspondence!</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve seen the difference that social media makes regarding the AoDLW. Letters in the past century were normally the main way people communicated at a distance. Some might catch up (or get to know a pen pal more closely) with long distance phone calls. But unless they actually met face to face, their lives were relatively isolated. Now it’s so easy to stay in touch. Some would say it’s too easy, but just because it’s easy shouldn&rsquo;t mean one should settle for shallow. Samuel Johnson wrote, “A short letter to a distant friend is, in my opinion, an insult like that of a slight bow or cursory salutation;—a proof of unwillingness to do much, even where there is a necessity of doing something.” But Johnson didn’t have email. The third rule is: <strong>Buy time by sending a note or SMS.</strong></p>\n<p>It is also common to send “newsletters” to multiple recipients, and I would argue that’s also a good use of technology. I loved writing annual letters to include with Christmas cards (writer’s block since my mom died, but that doesn’t distract from the principle), and I love getting the same from friends and family. It’s more challenging to write to an audience larger than one. Those letters can inspire personal correspondence, phone calls and face to face visits, though. I myself now have twenty years of snapshots of family life that gives me great enjoyment to share (reminisce) with my now-grown children and grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Finally, to my readers with whom I am behind in correspondence: Please forgive me.

At the least, save copies of what you write in your personal commonplace book so that changes in employment don't leave you without access to your own thoughts and ideas! Social networks in business situations are most susceptible to this.</p><p>My job responsibilities give me access to the <a href=\"https://community.workday.com/\">Workday Community</a> (WC). It's a walled garden with a different feel compared with Salesforce <a href=\"https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/\">Trailblazer Community</a> (SFDC TC). It struck me today that Workday's wall is high. They keep a very tight leash on customer access through Named Support Contacts (NSCs). Access to the WC is tightly controlled. You must be a customer. In contrast, SFDC's TC is open to anyone—customer or not.</p><p>I get it. SFDC is huge. The corporation has made enormous acquisitions, Tableau and Slack are a couple that caught my attention recently. I became a Workday customer through their acquisition of Adaptive Insights, now Workday Adaptive Planning, Adaptive for short. (Adaptive is a financial planning & analysis tool.) Workday is huge compared with Adaptive, but they are smaller than SFDC. Their technology doesn't seem quite as mature, though much progress has been made since I was introduced to the product four years ago.</p><p>I wrote an answer to a simple question today: What training is recommended for users new to Workday Adaptive Planning? You have to be a Workday customer to read <a href=\"https://community.workday.com/node/907863\">my answer</a>. This decreases my motivation to contribute to the community. Only a little, though. I can imagine why Workday controls access. Their technology doesn't yet have the broad market that SFDC has. No incentive to make knowledge accessible to non-customers (yet?).</p><p>Anyway, this is a blog post, not an essay. I don't have all the answers. But trust me on the Own Your Words™ advice. Don't lose your knowledge that is locked behind garden walls. (Following all contractual obligations, of course. Some content you write as an employee doesn't belong to you. You do read and understand before you sign anything, right?)</p><p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem;font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=67995878\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"File:Whose Knowledge? logo.svg\"</a><span> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Anasuyas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anasuyas</a></span> is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&atype=html\" style=\"margin-right: 5px;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&atype=html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"display: inline-block;white-space: none;margin-top: 2px;margin-left: 3px;height: 22px !important;\"><img style=\"height: inherit;margin-right: 3px;display: inline-block;\" src=\"https://search.openverse.engineering/static/img/cc_icon.svg?media_id=95f543fe-fec2-401a-be7f-a8b07f8e8b94\" /><img style=\"height: inherit;margin-right: 3px;display: inline-block;\" src=\"https://search.openverse.engineering/static/img/cc-by_icon.svg\" /><img style=\"height: inherit;margin-right: 3px;display: inline-block;\" src=\"https://search.openverse.engineering/static/img/cc-sa_icon.svg\" /></a></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m sitting at my kitchen table in my southeast-facing nook, enjoying the view of Pikes Peak outside my window [1], writing on my mbike. That&rsquo;s short for mind-bike, which is short for mind-bicycle, which is short for bicycle for the mind. I&rsquo;m too lazy to research the quote. Whether or not he said it, and regardless of the context in which it was said, I&rsquo;ll credit Steve Jobs with coining the description of a personal computer (PC) as a bicycle for the mind. <em>If</em> he said it, he said it in the earliest days of the PC, B.I. (Before the Internet), in the age of the ARPANET, of which I suspect Jobs was relatively ignorant because the ARPANET was not accessible from PCs. He was all about the PC. (Some say he invented it!) Modern mbikes unleash the power of the internet. An mbike is the third of four levels of computing power.</p>\n<p>I have written before about the four levels of computing power. (Ducksearch it.) The lowest level is six cubic inches of wireless computing in an LGR, which is short for little glowing rectangle. Everyone else calls an LGR a phone, which is short for smartphone. I used to think I could live with three cubic inches. That was how tiny the first iPhone was. I have never owned an iPhone. Steve Jobs did not invent the smartphone. The Handspring Trēo was my first smartphone—which, remember, is an LGR—in 2003. I upgraded to a Palm Prē in 2009, still about three cubic inches. These days, now that Jobs is dead (it didn&rsquo;t happen when he was alive because he was fixated on three cubic inches) at the lowest level, I need at least six cubic inches. An LG G7 suffices. It still fits in my pocket.</p>\n<p>The highest level is defined simply by a maximum-size display—the largest display an individual can afford. I&rsquo;m happy to go with the accepted term, big-screen TV, but let&rsquo;s shorten that to BSTV. I still use a now-obsolete HP SmartTV.</p>\n<p>Between LGR and BSTV are two more levels. When I want to read, I switch from my LGR to the second level: a tablet. I have an Amazon Kindle, but that&rsquo;s an appliance. My iPad has more computing power than my LGR, but less than the third level, my mbike.</p>\n<p>An mbike is bigger than a tablet and smaller than a BSTV. All the power of the internet is unleashed in mbikes. LGRs and tablets are not powerful enough to be bicycles for the mind. To be mobile, they make compromises on size, computing power, and electric power consumption. When we talk about the third level of computing power, we are talking about power with no compromises. My mbike is a notebook computer with a reasonably-sized clamshell design for integrated keyboard and display. My work mbike (wmbike for short) is a desktop tower with traditional keyboard, video (I love my 4K display!), and mouse (KVM). All are glowing rectangles: the LGR, the tablet, the mbike, and BSTV. (We spend too much time in front of glowing rectangles, don&rsquo;t you think?) Anyway, the mbike is special. It is where human creativity is fully unleashed. How creative can you get without a keyboard? [2]</p>\n<p><em>What about servers?</em> you ask. <em>What about them?</em> I answer. Servers are mbikes. And &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; is merely somebody else&rsquo;s mbike—<em>an mbike that you don&rsquo;t control</em>. The internet is simply LGRs, tablets, mbikes, and BSTVs talking to somebody else&rsquo;s mbike and through that mbike to other LGRs, tablets, mbikes, and BSTVs. Soon, neighbors won&rsquo;t need mbikes to use the internet. When that happens, human freedom and creativity will be expanded in peer-to-peer connections. Peer-to-peer (p2p) is not a very catchy name. It&rsquo;s all about decentralizing the internet. (Ok, that term isn&rsquo;t much better.) Decentralization, d14n for short (and decentralizing = d12g and decentralize = d10e and a decentralizer is a d10er), is another way of thinking about p2p. That takes us back to the way the internet <em>used to work</em>. Back when it was more free as in freedom. There are already some p2p services. (We won&rsquo;t be truly p2p anytime soon, unless we all want to get amateur radio licenses. I&rsquo;m considering it for myself, thinking of my friends Bdale and Stephen.) I&rsquo;m rambling too much. That&rsquo;s enough for today.</p>\n<p>I have spoken.</p>\n<p>[1] I would love to get to know you, Neighbor, well enough to have you at my home to enjoy my view! Let&rsquo;s connect! In the accompanying photo, you can see Pikes Peak as viewed from the bridge between America the Beautiful Park and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Museum.</p>\n<p>[2] Ok, ok, that&rsquo;s not quite accurate. My tablet (at the second level) is the platform for my recording studio, so I can create raw content for podcasts without an mbike. But I move to my mbike to <em>edit</em> my podcasts. (Audacity rocks!) I&rsquo;m talking about true human creativity. Creativity that extends beyond the effort that &ldquo;thinkers&rdquo; put into Facebook and Nextdoor posts and TikTok videos and tweets. We call it micro-blogging for a reason. Twitter and other micro-blog platforms compromise human creativity. God forbid if politics was ever exclusively energized by micro-blog-sized thoughts. Can you imagine the Federalist Papers as tweets? That&rsquo;s a Bad Idea.</p>\n<p><em>Edited to fix typos and add tbc tags; original word count was 878, character count was 5019.</em></p>\n<p><em>This post is tbci0828a; tbch0429a is a tag (Ducksearch it)</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

It still fits in my pocket.\n\nThe highest level is defined simply by a maximum-size display—the largest display an individual can afford. I'm happy to go with the accepted term, big-screen TV, but let's shorten that to BSTV. I still use a now-obsolete HP SmartTV.\n\nBetween LGR and BSTV are two more levels. When I want to read, I switch from my LGR to the second level: a tablet. I have an Amazon Kindle, but that's an appliance. My iPad has more computing power than my LGR, but less than the third level, my mbike.\n\nAn mbike is bigger than a tablet and smaller than a BSTV. All the power of the internet is unleashed in mbikes. LGRs and tablets are not powerful enough to be bicycles for the mind. To be mobile, they make compromises on size, computing power, and electric power consumption. When we talk about the third level of computing power, we are talking about power with no compromises. My mbike is a notebook computer with a reasonably-sized clamshell design for integrated keyboard and display. My work mbike (wmbike for short) is a desktop tower with traditional keyboard, video (I love my 4K display!), and mouse (KVM). All are glowing rectangles: the LGR, the tablet, the mbike, and BSTV. (We spend too much time in front of glowing rectangles, don't you think?) Anyway, the mbike is special. It is where human creativity is fully unleashed. How creative can you get without a keyboard? \\[2\\]\n\n_What about servers?_ you ask. _What about them?_ I answer. Servers are mbikes. And \"the cloud\" is merely somebody else's mbike—_an mbike that you don't control_. The internet is simply LGRs, tablets, mbikes, and BSTVs talking to somebody else's mbike and through that mbike to other LGRs, tablets, mbikes, and BSTVs. Soon, neighbors won't need mbikes to use the internet. When that happens, human freedom and creativity will be expanded in peer-to-peer connections. Peer-to-peer (p2p) is not a very catchy name. It's all about decentralizing the internet. (Ok, that term isn't much better.) Decentralization, d14n for short (and decentralizing = d12g and decentralize = d10e and a decentralizer is a d10er), is another way of thinking about p2p. That takes us back to the way the internet _used to work_. Back when it was more free as in freedom. There are already some p2p services. (We won't be truly p2p anytime soon, unless we all want to get amateur radio licenses. I'm considering it for myself, thinking of my friends Bdale and Stephen.) I'm rambling too much. That's enough for today.\n\nI have spoken.\n\n\\[1\\] I would love to get to know you, Neighbor, well enough to have you at my home to enjoy my view! Let's connect! In the accompanying photo, you can see Pikes Peak as viewed from the bridge between America the Beautiful Park and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Museum.\n\n\\[2\\] Ok, ok, that's not quite accurate. My tablet (at the second level) is the platform for my recording studio, so I can create raw content for podcasts without an mbike. But I move to my mbike to _edit_ my podcasts. (Audacity rocks!) I'm talking about true human creativity. Creativity that extends beyond the effort that \"thinkers\" put into Facebook and Nextdoor posts and TikTok videos and tweets. We call it micro-blogging for a reason. Twitter and other micro-blog platforms compromise human creativity. God forbid if politics was ever exclusively energized by micro-blog-sized thoughts. Can you imagine the Federalist Papers as tweets? That's a Bad Idea.\n\n_Edited to fix typos and add tbc tags; original word count was 878, character count was 5019._\n\n_This post is tbci0828a; tbch0429a is a tag (Ducksearch it)_\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/dfec6e5dfe.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"285\" alt=\"\" />\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I listened to <a href=\"https://www.dancarlin.com/product/common-sense-320-steering-into-the-iceberg\">Common Sense 320 Steering Into the Iceberg</a> by Dan Carlin aka DC. He grates on me. He meanders way too much. Whenever I listen to him I find myself shouting at the player, “Get on with it! Make your point!” I did it at a friend’s urging. It was tolerable at 1.7×. I calculate I saved 30 minutes. Here are highlights. He spends the first several minutes talking about … nothing. Total waste of time. Around 19:53 he is reflecting on POTUS45’s call for his supporters to refuse to accept his defeat at the polls. A rigged election will be the battle cry for civil war. I say who’s surprised? POTUS45 admires Putin and Kim Jong Un. At 29:35 I was thinking about DC’s references to Caesar crossing the Rubicon. He says Congress did nothing. But the House sent impeachment articles to the Senate. It’s the Republican Senate who is not leading. Now I understand how Rome ended up with Caesar. Around 34:45 he calls for oppositional voting. Vote against the authoritarian. He rants about POTUS45 with his finger on the nuclear button. He urges us to steer away from the civil war iceberg. Plus the harmful conspiracies iceberg. At 42:00 he names QAnon. At 51:40 he talks about non-violence. Then he riffs on the idea that the US is a democratic republic. By 1:07:00 he is using the metaphor of a bus with 60 steering wheels. He is Jeffersonian,” a we the people guy.” Wraps up with a desire for a ”meeting of the minds.”Oh the drama, ending with Franklin’s quote: ”A republic, if your can keep it.” Mic drop, ending at 1:13:00.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
